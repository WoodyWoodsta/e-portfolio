      <h2>About Me</h2>
      Currently an undergraduate student studying towards a <b>BSc in Engineering in Mechatronics</b> at the University of Cape Town, I am a huge fan of innovative thinking and enjoy mixing this way of seeing the world with creativity in a manner which uplifts others. I rise up to life challenges and practice this in juggling university studies with keeping fit, learning new tricks and skills, freelance graphic design and music. I turn down conventional thinking and substitute it with the will to find a <b>better</b> way!
