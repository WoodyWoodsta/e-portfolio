      <h2>New Venture Planning Project</h2>
      <p>
        A course taken during my 4th year of Mechatronics, <b>New Venture Planning</b>, involved a group project in which we were tasked to develop a product idea and the business plan around it. The deliverables of the group project were a presentation aimed at an audience made up of potential investors, a poster with the financial and operational outline and a full business plan covering the product description, marketing analysis and plan, financial plan and operational plan. The business plan is summarised below.
      </p>

      <h3>Product Description</h3>
      <p>
        The developed idea aims to solve the recently confirmed negative effects of excessive blue light exposure on the eye. The product is a desk lamp, named the <b>Lucerna Lamp</b>, that changes colour temperature based on the time of day (position of the sun) as well as other environmental conditions. It does so in an attempt to immitate the sun's light temperature observed as it sets, and therefore bring about the effects that this change in colour has on our eyes and body. As the sun rises, the temperature of the sun's light that reaches us after passing through the atmosphere transitions from containing only redder frequencies to a more complete light frequency composition. The inverse occurs as the sun sets.<br><br>

        The lamp has a minimalistic, disc shaped head fixed to a base to result in a compelling desk piece that would not only be appealing to those willing to improve their health, but also those who enjoy the idea of a good looking desk setup. The ambient sensors are mounted to the one side of the head, whilst the other side is occupied by capacitive controls allowing brightness and temperature to be adjusted. The <b>Lucerna Lamp</b> will also connect to nearby devices via WiFi to be controlled using a web interface on a PC or the accompanying <b>Lucerna</b> app on a mobile device.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both images are 3D rendered impressions of the <b>Lucerna Lamp</b>, which were created in Blender. The renders were used in the presentation that was required for the project, together with a poster, business plan and investment proposal presentation which can be viewed using the button below.

      <h3>Marketing Plan</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Lucerna</b> aims to develop the idea of health and style in the lamp product through the marketing of it as well as through the development of public awareness of the brand. It was recognised that the lamp could easily drown in the vast lighting market, however, with simple and professional marketing content aimed at the chosen target markets, the brand <b>Lucerna</b> could be made iconic and trusted. It was clear through research that the most effective target markets are office workers and students.<br><br>

        The promotional content is planned to start with online promotions through the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> campaign page in the form of videos of 3D rendered animations. A website will be made public to provide more information and promote greater reach. After the crowdfunding period, the marketing will progress to physical exhibitions and reviews by well known online presences.

      <h3>Financial Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The business will be initiated with an investment from friends and family and further supported by a crowdfunding campaign through <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>. The choice of a crowdfunded approach was motivated by the prospect of leveraging the publicity to generate an awareness of the product and of <b>Lucerna</b> as a brand. The possibilities of extra investment from third parties is incorporated into the plan to support the development of the product.
      </p>

      <h3>Operational Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The production of the lamps will start out in a garage which will be set up with the required equipment. The development of the initial proof of concepts and prototypes will also be done at this location. After the 3rd year of predicted sales and investment, the production of products will move to a much larger factory space where capacity will increase to meet the projected demands. Both locations will be equipped for safety of production and will comply with working condition regulations.<br><br>

        The operational plan also highlights the executive board and their responsibilities as well as planned employment of staff.
